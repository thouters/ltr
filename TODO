FIXME: .diff compares flags, will compare unique attributes;
 restrict this to c copy/checked

removing file from disk changes it to "ghost" state.
ltr tidy makes you choose:
 a) propagate deleted status to other boxes (ltr purge filespec)
 b) marking file(s) as "skip" for local box (ltr discard filespec)



node-logentry-example:
    doctype: node
    log: {"{{timestamp}}":[{"type":"edit"},{}]}

log-view-summary-example:
    ([timestamp,boxid],[fileid,action])

ltr update (trigger couchdb replicate)
ltr: "ping boxname" command (attempt to access other box and set it as origin) 

node.present -> create node document for every drop.
node{ftype=dir} -> documenttype node

ltrbox crawler: unittests
document: pull request: {ctime, status, uri=user@host:/path}
client: wait on _changes for pull requests
ltr: node attribute 'missing'; missing.append(boxname) for boxname if boxname.policy == complete
path property: use parent id
code: license headers
status: recognise change in filetypes
ltrbox property: repository (expect no user edits)
ltrnode property: added-to-volume-time (eg: pickup-time?)
client: status diffstat-style output
